# UniversityRecommenderSystem

This project is one that I'm building as a proof of concept for a University recommendation system, that aims to provide highschool students with a personalized recommendation for university programs they may be interested in applying for. It aims to solve the issues with the current school system, which pressures individuals to go into University no matter if they have found a passion or not. This directly results in high drop out rates among first year university students, mental health issues and a lack of interest in their programs. It aims to provide targeted recommendations for students to help them find programs that they are much more passionate about. 

Through this project I am aiming to practice my AI integration skills and machine learning training skills. I am currently working to test ml models that would best group programs based on their descriptions which have been scraped from the UBC website.
